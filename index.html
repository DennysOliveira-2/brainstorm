                        <p>We, as human beings, <strong>need</strong> to socialize. At least, the major part of the humanity isn't used and don't get comfortable when we need to do everything remotely.</p>
                        <P>A good example of that is how good are the students handling the remote-class situation - most of them aren't comfortable with it.</P>
                        <p>That said, pandemics and outbreaks that demand we being away from each other do not cooperate with our psychological health. Getting out of our routine can be rough.</p>
                        <p>Thinking about that, instead of finding ways to lock people or tell them not to leave their houses, why not find a way for them to leave, but safely? </p>
                        <p>This is where our idea was born during NASA Space Apps COVID-19 Challenge at 2020.</p>
                        <p>At the beginning, the idea was a mobile application meant to safely promote better and less crowded places for people to shop. We further developed into branches for the application to be more complex and be able to be modified into an economic-focused</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>The Implementation</h3>
                        <p>The architecture of the software is meant to be simple and only an example of how it is viable to be built using JavaScript.</p>
                        <p>At the beginning we thought about building it with React Native as a mobile application, but developing as a inexperienced, both on many languages and also at hackatons - we would not be able to build it on time.</p>
                        <p>So... This repository is meant to show an application (with little experience on JS) capable of GeoLocating the user and displaying in real-time places and their population.</p>
                        <p>That said, we could prevent people from gathering up at the same market, decreasing COVID spread rates.</p>
                        <p>We decided to show only crowding instead of each person - as some GPS-based applications do, to avoid malicious usage of our software. Of course, the code is rough but the idea is there.</p>

                        <h3>Expansion</h3>
                        <p>Thinking about pandemics, if every single person watched every place before going there would decrease pandemic spread rates significantly.</p>
                        <p>We thought about this application as being able to be both social and economic viable - such as gathering data tables and being able to parse information about specific places - lessening the time spent wherever, as time is money.</p>
                        <p>This application is meant to be social and help avoid COVID-19 or other pandemic outbreaks that can happen, but could be further developed.</p>

                        <p>As I specified briefly above, developing this completely "working-version" in two days would be nearly impossible due to my (Dennys) inexperience on Mobile - that's why we decided to focus the architectural building and abstract funcionality of the project.</p>
